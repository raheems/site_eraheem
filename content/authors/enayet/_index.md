I am a Data Scientist and Statistician with more than 18 years of experience in academia and industry combined. Currently, as a healthcare data scientist, I provide strategic guidance for the development, validation, and use of algorithms for data based decision making.

I have been using __R__ for over 18 years for statistical analysis and research. Currently, I mostly use __Python__ and __PySpark__. In the past I've used __SAS__ for management of structured data and for standard statistical analysis.
